# Investment Risk Management Project

## Overview

This project analyzes investment risk using the **Treynor Ratio** and **Value at Risk (VaR)** to assess risk-adjusted returns and downside risk. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into balancing returns and risk exposure in an investment portfolio.

## Key Objectives

- **Treynor Ratio**: Measure return per unit of systematic risk (Beta).
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Estimate potential losses at different confidence levels.

## Project Structure

1. **Understanding Risk** – Overview of market risk and risk-adjusted returns.
2. **Monthly Returns & Standard Deviation** – Compute returns and volatility.
3. **Beta Calculation** – Measure stock sensitivity to the market.
4. **Treynor Ratio Calculation** – Evaluate risk-adjusted returns.
5. **Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation** – Assess downside risk.
6. **Visualizations & Insights** – Graph results and summarize findings.

## Insights

- **Netflix (NFLX) has the highest risk-adjusted return** but also the highest downside risk.
- **Google (GOOG) shows the lowest Treynor Ratio**, indicating less efficient risk-adjusted returns.
- **Apple (AAPL) demonstrates the lowest volatility**, making it relatively stable.
- **The FAANG Portfolio benefits from diversification**, reducing overall risk.
